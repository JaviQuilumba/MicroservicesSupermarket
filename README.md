# Microservices for a supermarket

<p>
The microservices project for a streaming platform tries to simulate a microservices architecture, it has three microservices: product list services, customer services and email services. Each of these microservices has independent functions such as listing products, listing customers, and sending emails. It should be noted that this is just a project, it is just a simulation of microservices.
Dockerfile and Docker-compose are also used for creating Docker images.
